## About

##### My name is Vincentius Samuel Gondokusumo.

I am currently pursuing an Information Systems and Technology degree at Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia.  
I am a disciplined, highly-motivated student who's passionate about programming, especially the world of Web Development and Data Science. I also enjoy learning,
experiencing new things, and challenging myself to greater limits. I believe that by pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone everyday,
we can be better than who we are the day before.

“Over the course of your life, you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you, 
that you do not deserve, and that are not always warranted.  
But you have to put your head down, and fight, fight, fight. Never ever ever ever give up.   
Don't give in, don't back down, and never stop doing what you know is right.  
Nothing worth doing, ever ever ever came easy.” - President Donald J. Trump 

“Demand the best from yourself. The more people tell you that it is impossible, that it can't be done,
the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong. Treat the word 'impossible' as nothing more than motivation.” - President Donald J. Trump

"As much as we can achieve, there's always new beginnings and there's always new things to do." - Jon Dorenbos, Philadelphia Eagles
